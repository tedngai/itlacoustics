<h2 id="content">How to read this graph</h2>
<p>The x-axis represents time of day as well as week of the semester, while Y-axis represents day of the week. The charts below has the X and Y axis labels turned off for the sake clarity since there're so much information, the graphics gets confusing easily. To get detailed information of a particular room, just hover your mouse over the graph and you will get a read out showing you the date, time, day of week, and the course title.</p>
